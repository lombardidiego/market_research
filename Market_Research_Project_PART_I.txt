Market Research Express

Introduction/Business Problem
Market research is an activity that requires important resources, particularly time and money. This situation creates a problem for those organizations that do not have the necessary resources to know the market better, and thus be able to offer a better product or service. In this sense, from this application a tool is offered so that anyone can know relevant aspects of the market in any location, according to their interest. Thus, with this tool just by placing an address in a few minutes you can have relevant information about the number of premises, type of premises, the density of these establishments in the defined space, among other things.

Data
The data used to work comes from Foursquare. Specifically, we work with the name of the establishments, their location (georeferenced in latitude and longitude), the type of establishment (according to the categories offered by Foursquare, in addition to its own classification), the distance of the establishments from the selected central point , and the valuation of the establishments. The data can be text (names and categories), or numeric (coordinates and distance). In addition there are own calculations in the application.

For example, with the present application, you can obtain a dataframe with 100 establishments, and a certain number of categories, differentiating between restaurants, bars, cinemas, etc.

Market Research Express

Introduction/Business Problem
Market Research is an area that requires an important effort to gather information for each client. On many occasions these clients want a "first vision" of their market. These requests are usually accompanied by a sense of urgency. In this sense, I have designed this application to be able to know the environment of any market in a few minutes, particularly elements of the geographical distribution of the premises, the average distance of the chosen point (indicating the degree of density), as well as a brief analysis of the predominant names (as a basis for future Branding).

To run this application, you only need to have Foursquare credentials, and the location you want to evaluate.

Data
It works with the data provided in Foursquare, specifically: name of the place, location (latitude and longitude), category, and distance of the selected point.
